<p> DESIGN

<p> The design taken to make the pieces of the product was that of the heroes of the famous game Dota 2, this was chosen by the amount of existing players and fans.

                    <p class="think__details__extra__description">A laser cutter is a machine that uses the power of a laser to engrave materials. You can use these machines to make industrial things, but also in small businesses and for personal use. It will take a bit of practice to use a laser cutter. Here you will find the necessary steps to learn how to use a laser cutter.</p>

2. DESIGN OF THE PROPOSAL WITH PARAMETERS </p>
                    <p class="think__details__info__cont"><p>Everyone has ever programmed a spreadsheet to solve a certain numerical problem. Starting from initial values ​​chosen by us with intention, and under the rules that we have imposed on the system in its formulation, we are able to obtain complex results instantaneously, which also can be recalculated immediately by simply varying the original parameters.
                    <p> The basis of the parametric design is the generation of geometry from the definition of a family of initial parameters and the programming of the formal relations that they keep between them. Consists of the use of variables and algorithms to generate a tree of mathematical and geometric relationships that allow not only to reach a design, but to generate the entire range of possible solutions that the variability of the initial parameters allow us.
                   <p>ADVANTAGE
                   <p> The advantages of this process are immediate. It is a qualitative leap in the quality of our process, not being constrained by the tool we use; now we will be the ones who design our own tool. On the other hand, the parametric design is fundamental to reduce the effort necessary to modify and create variants in the design. Generating an automated process eliminates tedious repetitive tasks, the need for complicated manual calculations, the possibility of human error, and causes large alterations in the result only with slight variations in the initial parameters. It is the difference between using the 'Cube' command a thousand times, entering its center and its dimensions, or designing a 'Family of Variable Height Cubes' command from our predefined rules of variability.
                   <p>And finally, the effort used to add this layer of intelligence to our design rewards us with the exploration of the possibilities of our parameters, and the surprise in the discovery of unimagined solutions generated by our creation.

                    <p>PARAMETRIC THINKING
                    <p>
It introduces the change of mentality between the search for a formal and concrete formal end, and the conscientious design of the factors and the stages that we use to reach it. It is the use of algorithms and advanced computational means not to draw forms, but to create formal possibilities. It is not producing a solution, but a family of possible solutions. It is the change between using drawing software not as a tool for representation, but as a means of design. It is, in short, the new paradigm.
                   <p>If you are ready to stop being a mere user of AutoCAD, and you are the one who designs the rules of the game, in ParametricCamp we have a lot to offer you.
